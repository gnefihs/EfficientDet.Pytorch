# EE6934 Group 1 Project #2
This is repo contains 2 notebooks for training testing of detections using EfficientDetB0, and EfficientDetB0 prepended with our propose "Simple Conv SR" model.

1. Please install requirements.txt
2. Open `training.ipynb` for instructions on training and evaluating the models
3. 

### Note
* This repo is forked from https://github.com/toandaominh1997/EfficientDet.Pytorch, where EfficientDet is implemented in PyTorch.
* The "Simple Conv SR" model we proposed is implemented in the `models/efficientdet.py` script in `class EfficentDet_Up`
